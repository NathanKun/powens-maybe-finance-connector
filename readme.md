# Powens Maybe-Finance Connector

(Actually this is not a connector, since maybe has no API for now)

Use Powens' account & transactions APIs to retrieve account transactions data.

Convert data to CSV format to be imported manually in Maybe (no maybe API for now).

Listen to Powens Webhook, when account/transaction are synced on Powens, webhook is called, and will fetch latest data from Powens.

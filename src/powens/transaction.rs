/**
Structure representing a Powens Bank Transaction.

See https://docs.powens.com/api-reference/products/data-aggregation/bank-transactions#transaction-object.

Has totally 39 fields during my test, but not all fields are documented.

Removed some fields base on a check of latest 100 transactions:
- 18 fields which are always null.
- id_category which has no official doc and is always 9998.
- state which has no official doc and is always "parsed".
- documents_count which has no official doc and is always 0.
- information field which is always an empty object.
